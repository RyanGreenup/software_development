# Implementation: A PySide6 GUI

Create a GitHub repository that demonstrates an Egui application that acheives one of the following:


    - Stores bookmarks in a SQLite database
    - A chatbot that uses llamma.cpp and phi3-mini to provide feedback on code that is in the clipboard

The repository should include the following:

    - A static Site using GitHub Pages
        - use mdbook, quartz or mkdocs
    - Produce an AI graphic for this project (use Stable Diffusion or DALL-E, seek guidance from the community e.g. [pallets/click](
    - A test suite
    - A Justfile to automate the build process
    - A basic CLI interface using Clap or Click / Typer
    - Dependencies managed using Cargo or Poetry
    - Use obs to record a video on the GitHub
        - Use ffmpeg to convert this video to a .gif and include it in the README
            - Include the ffmpeg command in the Justfile
