# Object Oriented and Procedural Approaches to Software Development

## Student Activities

### Activities

- Write a function with and without type annotations in Python, take a screenshot of the LSP providing autocomplete when using type annotations
- Write an example of a closure in Python and Rust
    - In Rust, demonstrate the closure carrying its environment.
- Write a python script to count the number of words in a textfile and produce an ascii histogram of the word frequency
    - Using only Functions
        - Write this using a top down approach, i.e. write the main function first, then write subfunctions with tests and then sub-sub functions
            - Describe whether this makes the code easier to write, or more difficult, what is your preferred approach?
    - Rewrite the code using only classes and methods

### Readings

- [9. Classes — Python 3.12.4 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
    - In a Jupyter Notebook, recreate two new examples for each provided in the documentation, these will be discussed in class
- Rewrite the CLI program you wrote in the previous tutorial using as many objects as possible
- Read § 6.7 of Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp
- Review the rewritten CLI program by adapting the advice offered by Knupp
- Read chapter 2 and 3 of Booch, Grady, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, 3rd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 2007
    - Create an example of Polymorphism
