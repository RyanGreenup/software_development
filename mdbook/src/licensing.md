# Licensing

If you don't licence your code, you're not giving anyone permission to use it.

If you do licence your code, you're bound by the terms of the licence and you're not allowed to use it in ways that the licence doesn't allow. You are not allowed to re-interpet the licence, that's a lawyers job. You may relicence your code, but you must be careful to ensure that you are not violating the terms of the original licence.

Broadly speaking:

  - MIT is the most permissive licence, it allows anyone to do anything with your code as long as they give you credit.
      - Used by the Rust  and Julia programming language.
      - BSD is similar to MIT, but it has a clause that says you can't use the name of the author to promote your product.
          - The First chapter of *Absolute OpenBSD* has a narrative on the history of BSD and motivates the appreciation for this licence.
          - Used by the BSDs
  - GPL is more restrictive, it allows anyone to do anything with your code but it requires that they also licence their code under the GPL.
      - Copyleft, this ensures that the code remains open source.
      - Used by the Linux kernel, GNU project and many other open source projects.

The long and short of it is, GPL is designed to keep code open source, MIT is designed to make it easy to use code. The choice of licence is up to you, but it is important to licence your code.
