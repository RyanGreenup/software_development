# Introduction to the Unit

This unit focuses on developing skills and habits of best practice in software development using Python and Rust. Students will practice software development focusing particularly on documentation, debugging, version control, object oriented design, test-driven development (TDD), tooling, and more!


This course follows three main sections:

- Best Practices of Software Development in Python & Rust
    - **Implementation**: Develop a CLI / TUI with Rust and Python that includes a git repo with conventional commits [^1720952337], documentation, test coverage and a static site.
- Object Oriented Programming in Python and Rust
    - **Implementation**: Develop an immediate mode Gui in Rust, as above
- Object Oriented Design
    - **Implementation**: Develop a GUI in PySide6, as above


Students will maintain these projects in a public `git` repo and be required to submit pull requests (PR), report issues to each other and discuss development on Matrix.

This unit aims to develop practical skills to ground theoretical concepts while encouraging students to reflect upon the best practices in software development. This is acheived by devloping habits and reinforcing workflows around modern tooling widely adoptoed in the dev space, this foundation will be a platform that the future practioner can build upon as they grow. This course is designed for undergraduate students who are familiar with basic programming, seeking to deepen their understanding by developing software.

In addition, we encourage students track their environment configuration with `git` and share it with the class. This will help motivate the importance of reproducibility, documentation and collaboration in software development.

Finally, students will be asked to reflect on the development experience in both languages for documentation, TDD, typing etc. Software developers use a variety of different languages and must understand the benefits and differences of each language to be effective in the field.


This subject is entirely focused on practical implementation and reflection. There is no one right answer to software development and developers tend to have a lot of opinions. The aim here is to equip students with a foundational workflow that can be adapted to a future career in software development.
